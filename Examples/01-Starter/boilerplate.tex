% the stuff inside [] is the default font size and the stuff inside {} is the
% document class, which comes with some predefined behavior (more on that later)
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\begin{document}
This is a simple \LaTeX document

this makes a new line

if you type out a long sentence, latex will automatically create a new line for
you. Also a single \textbackslash n will not do much. Two create a new line.

this dude \textbackslash \textbackslash will also create a new \\
line

if you wanna write math make sure to add \$ around it $(x+1)$

two \$\$ around some math will put you in new line math mode like this $$(x+1)$$
